# client-server-chat
CS372 Portfolio Project - a simple client-server chat project using python sockets

To run this project, start up the server on your machine with the command:
    python server.py {portNumber}
Where {portNumber} is the port on your localhost you wish the server to run on.

Next, start up the client in a second shell with the command:
    python client.py {portNumber}
Use the same {portNumber} as before.

You can now chat between server and client using the two shells.
Type '/q' in the client to quit the chat programs.
